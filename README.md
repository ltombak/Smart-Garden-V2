# Smart-Garden-V2
> A low-power sensor for agriculture, connected via LoRaWAN.

## Description
This project is a second iteration of LoRa sensor for agriculture. The previous version used an Arduino Pro mini as controller and some common sensors for soil moisture, temperature and humidity data.

The goal of this V2 is to lower the cost of a node with a more professional approach and also lower the power consumption for an extended battery life.
The node will be able to measure 4 data:
- Soil moisture
- Ambient Temperature
- Ambient Humidity
- Luminosity levels
